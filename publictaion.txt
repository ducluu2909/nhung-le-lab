Abstract: The matrix of the stationary phase is a crucial element in affinity chromatography for protein purification. Various materials, including polymer or magnetic materials, have been employed as the matrix in the purification of His-tagged protein. Here, for the first time, we utilized a combination of melanin and alginate, both natural polymer materials, to synthesize Ni-melanin/alginate (Ni-M/A) beads for His-tagged protein purification. We investigated the binding of His-tagged Mpro on the Ni-M/A beads, referred to as Ni-M/A-Mpro, and assessed the elution efficiency of Mpro from the beads. Our examination involved FTIR, EDS, XRD, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting methods. FTIR spectra revealed notable changes in the stretching patterns and intensities of hydroxyl, amine, carbonyl, imine and amide chemical groups, when Mpro protein was present in the Ni-M/A sample. XRD spectra demonstrated the occurrence of two Nickel peaks at 35–40 deg and 40–45 deg in Ni-M/A, but only one nickel peak at 35–40 deg in Ni-M/A-Mpro, indicating the binding of Mpro on the Nickel ions. EDS analysis reported a decrease in the concentration of Nickel on the surface of Ni-M/A from 16% to 7% when Mpro protein was loaded into the stationary phase. Importantly, our data indicated that the purity of the His-tagged protein Mpro after purification reached 97% after just one-step purification using the Ni-M/A stationary phase. Moreover, the binding capacity of Ni-M/A for Mpro was approximately 5.2 mg/g with recovery efficiency of 40%. Our results suggested Ni-M/A as a highly potential solid phase for affinity chromatography in the purification of His-tagged protein.

AB  - In this study, for the first time, nanobody conjugated beads were developed to 
      enrich botulinum serotype A. We evaluated two types of nanobody A8-functionalized 
      magnetic beads, both of which effectively captured and enriched BoNT/A from 
      dilute solutions and complex protein mixtures, achieving a concentration increase 
      of approximately 12- to 30-fold. The A8@N-beads showed higher binding capacity 
      than the A8@S-beads, suggesting that our self-synthesized NH(2) beads work well 
      in this application. Our data serve as evidence that using different bead types 
      with nanobody conjugation is a promising enrichment approach for further 
      detection of Lc/A, particularly in applications involving low-abundance targets 
      or complex sample matrices, such as food safety screening or clinical 
      diagnostics.

Abstract
Nanobodies which are single-domain antibodies derived from the Variable Heavy domain of Heavy-chain-only antibodies (VHHs) found in camels and sharks, represent a novel approach for enhancing the detection and neutralization of food toxins. Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), a potent neurotoxin produced by Clostridium botulinum, can cause severe poisoning even in minimal amounts (approximately 1 - 2 ng/kg), necessitating the development of highly sensitive detection methods. In this study, we recombinantly synthesized the nanobodies ALc-B8 (A8) and JNE-B10 (J10), which specifically bind to the light chains of BoNT type A (BoNT/A) and BoNT type B (BoNT/B), respectively. Optimal conditions for expressing nanobodies A8 (33 kDa) and J10 (32 kDa) were identified using the pET28a vector in Escherichia coli  BL21 (DE3) RIL bacteria, with induction by 0.5 mM IPTG at an OD600 of approximately 0.6 - 0.8 for 16 - 18 hours at 16℃. The purified nanobodies A8 and J10, yielding 10 - 20 mg/L of culture, were able to specifically recognize the recombinant BoNT/A and BoNT/B light chains at a concentration of 100 μg/mL in Western blotting. These findings provide a foundation for the application of these nanobodies in the detection and neutralization of botulinum toxins.
